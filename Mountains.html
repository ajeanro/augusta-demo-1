                <h2>Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania</h2>
                    <p>At 5885 m (19,308 ft) high <strong>Kilimanjaro</strong> is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest free-standing mountain in the world. Actually it is a volcano, composed of three distinct cones. It is not a very difficult mountain to climb – you don’t have to be a professional.</p>

                    <p>On the top of it there are glaciers that are really pretty.</p>
                    <p>However, the sickness due to the altitude often prevents from reaching the 5,895 m (19,341 ft) tall peak.</p>

                    <p>The mount <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro">Kilimanjaro</a> with three volcanic cones, <em>"Kibo", "Mawenzi", and "Shira"</em>, is a dormant volcano in Tanzania. It is the highest mountain in Africa.</p>
                    <p>The mountain is part of the Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major climbing destination. The mountain has been the subject of many scientific studies because of its shrinking glaciers and disappearing ice fields.</p>
